                Dark spruce forest frowned on either side the frozen waterway. The trees had been stripped by a recent
                wind
                of their white covering of frost, and they seemed to lean towards each other, black and ominous, in the
                fading light. A vast silence reigned over the land. The land itself was a desolation, lifeless, without
                movement, so lone and cold that the spirit of it was not even that of sadness. There was a hint in it of
                laughter, but of a laughter more terrible than any sadness—a laughter that was mirthless as the smile of
                the
                sphinx, a laughter cold as the frost and partaking of the grimness of infallibility. It was the
                masterful
                and incommunicable wisdom of eternity laughing at the futility of life and the effort of life. It was
                the
                Wild, the savage, frozen-hearted Northland Wild.
            </p>
            <p class="top-text">
                But there was life, abroad in the land and defiant. Down
                the frozen waterway toiled a string of wolfish dogs. Their bristly fur was rimed with frost. Their
                breath
                froze in the air as it left their mouths, spouting forth in spumes of vapour that settled upon the hair
                of
                their bodies and formed into crystals of frost. Leather harness was on the dogs, and leather traces
                attached
                them to a sled which dragged along behind. The sled was without runners. It was made of stout
                birch-bark,
                and its full surface rested on the snow. The front end of the sled was turned up, like a scroll, in
                order to
                force down and under the bore of soft snow that surged like a wave before it. On the sled, securely
                lashed,
                was a long and narrow oblong box.
            </p>
            <p class="top-text">
                There were other things on the sled—blankets, an axe, and a coffee-pot and
                frying-pan; but prominent, occupying most of the space, was the long and narrow oblong box. In advance
                of
                the dogs, on wide snowshoes, toiled a man. At the rear of the sled toiled a second man. On the sled, in
                the
                box, lay a third man whose toil was over,—a man whom the Wild had conquered and beaten down until he
                would
                never move nor struggle again. It is not the way of the Wild to like movement. Life is an offence to it,
                for
                life is movement; and the Wild aims always to destroy movement. It freezes the water to prevent it
                running
                to the sea; it drives the sap out of the trees till they are frozen to their mighty hearts; and most
                ferociously and terribly of all does the Wild harry and crush into submission man—man who is the most
                restless of life, ever in revolt against the dictum that all movement must in the end come to the
                cessation
                of movement.

                But at front and rear, unawed and indomitable, toiled the two men who were not yet dead. Their
                bodies were covered with fur and soft-tanned leather. Eyelashes and cheeks and lips were so coated with
                the
                crystals from their frozen breath that their faces were not discernible. This gave them the seeming of
                ghostly masques, undertakers in a spectral world at the funeral of some ghost. But under it all they
                were
                men, penetrating the land of desolation and mockery and silence, puny adventurers bent on colossal
                adventure, pitting themselves against the might of a world as remote and alien and pulseless as the
                abysses
                of space.
